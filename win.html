       <h1>Blender Player</h1>
       <p>The Dutch animation studio NeoGeo (not associated with the Neo Geo video game hardware brand) started to develop Blender
    as an in-house application, and based on the timestamps for the first source files, January 2, 1994 is considered to be
    Blender's birthday.[13] The version 1.00 was released in January 1995,[14] with the primary author being company
    co-owner and software developer Ton Roosendaal. The name Blender was inspired by a song by the Swiss electronic band
    Yello, from the album Baby which NeoGeo used in its showreel.[15][16] Some of the design choices and experiences for
    Blender were carried over from an earlier software application, called Traces, that Roosendaal developed for NeoGeo on
    the Commodore Amiga platform during the 1987–1991 period.[17]
    
    On January 1, 1998, Blender was released publicly online as SGI freeware.[1] NeoGeo was later dissolved and its client
    contracts were taken over by another company. After NeoGeo's dissolution, Ton Roosendaal founded Not a Number
    Technologies (NaN) in June 1998 to further develop Blender, initially distributing it as shareware until NaN went
    bankrupt in 2002. This also meant, at the time, discontinuing the development of Blender.[18]
    
    In May 2002, Roosendaal started the non-profit Blender Foundation, with the first goal to find a way to continue
    developing and promoting Blender as a community-based open-source project. On July 18, 2002, Roosendaal started the
    "Free Blender" campaign, a crowdfunding precursor.[19][20] The campaign aimed at open-sourcing Blender for a one-time
    payment of €100,000 (US$100,670 at the time), with the money being collected from the community.[21] On September 7,
    2002, it was announced that they had collected enough funds and would release the Blender source code. Today, Blender is
    free and open-source software, largely developed by its community as well as 24 employees employed by the Blender
    Institute.[22]
    
    The Blender Foundation initially reserved the right to use dual licensing, so that, in addition to GPL-2.0-or-later,
    Blender would have been available also under the Blender License that did not require disclosing source code but
    required payments to the Blender Foundation. However, they never exercised this option and suspended it indefinitely in
    2005.[23] Blender is solely available under "GNU GPLv2 or any later" and was not updated to the GPLv3, as "no evident
    benefits" were seen.[24]
    
    In 2019, with the release of version 2.80, the integrated game engine for making and prototyping video games was
    removed; Blender's developers recommended users migrate to more powerful open source game engines such as Godot
    instead.</p>
